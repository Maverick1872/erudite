## Book Metadata APIs
* Goodreads - 12/08/2020 is being deprecated apparently
* Google - meh api so given a single test book request
* ISBNdb - 10$ minimum
* Open Library - crowd sourced
    * Curious if this application could be used to backfill their data when missing???
* SHOP.COM is also maybe barely a contender
* Amazon Product API?
